👋 Hey there! Welcome to the project's devcontainer. It's based on the versatile Codespace universal image.
   - This container has what you need for this project- Python, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and a lot more. Want to see the full list? Check it out here: https://github.com/h1zardian/cicd-pipeline-project
   - If you want to tweak it further to suit your needs, find out how here: https://aka.ms/configure-codespace

🔍 To dig deeper into VS Code, use the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P or F1).

📝 Edit away and just customize the code, and let the devcontainer handle the rest...
