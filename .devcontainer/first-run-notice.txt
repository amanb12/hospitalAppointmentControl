👋 Welcome to the devcontainer of my project! This container is based on the Codespace universal image. 
   - It includes runtimes and tools for Python, Docker, Terraform, Ansible and more. See the full list here: https://github.com/h1zardian/cicd-pipeline-project-repo
   - Want to customize it even more? Learn more here: https://aka.ms/configure-codespace

🔍 To explore VS Code to its fullest, search using the Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P or F1).

📝 Edit away, run your app as usual, and the devcontainer will automatically make it available for you to access...
